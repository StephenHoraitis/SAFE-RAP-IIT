Project Idea Overview: SAFE RAP (Save Animals From Euthanization - Rescue Animals Project)
Thousands of animals are euthanized each year in the USA and Australia alone. This application seeks to reduce those numbers. “SAFE RAP” will be both an Android and IOS application targeted towards those who are looking to adopt a pet and/or help contribute to shelter animals. This application will also be catered for Animal shelters and other organisations that deal with abandoned pets, allowing them to put the animal up for adoption via the application. This application will primarily run similar to a ‘dating app’, in which the animals (primarily dogs and cats) will be put on the page with a small bio, to which the users are able to swipe left or right depending on which they are interested in. Information is exchanged as well as any payment for animals rescued. Users will also be able to donate to the animal shelters.
