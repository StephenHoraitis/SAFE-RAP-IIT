# Personal Information:

My name is Stephen Horaitis (see Figure 1) and I am 19 years old as of the 10th of February. I have lived in Melbourne, Australia all my live and come from a Greek family, which therefore means that I can also speak, read, and write Greek. Currently, the highest level of education that I have completed is Year 12 VCE in 2020, and am now studying a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT University. As for my hobbies, I have taken part in my local tennis club, soccer club and swimming club. Furthermore, over the years I have completed up to Grade 5 in electric guitar and have also received my third dan black belt in Taekwondo.

# Interest in IT:

I am interested in the continuously growing impact that technology has on our world, but also the ways in which it continues to change day-by-day. I like to think about the possibilities for the future involving technology and what will be achievable in the years to come.

Furthermore, the flexibility in roles and work involved within IT, gives me the opportunity to work anywhere in the world, something that I would enjoy doing.

My interest in technology was sparked by my father who works in this area; he was able to explain to me the ins and outs of the industry, but also the countless opportunities which are available in this area of expertise.

Upon deciding which university to attend, I came to the decision of RMIT University due to several factors:

-   <u>Practical learning / Flexible delivery within courses and subjects</u>

When going through and comparing the course structure of Information Technology against other universities, it was RMIT’s practical focus in teaching methods and the flexibility within the course and subjects, that pushed me more towards it.

-   <u>Includes entrepreneurial elements</u>

Whilst examining my future study options, I was interested in courses that contained entrepreneurial elements. The RMIT course structure, had just that!

-   <u>Family members are alumni</u>

I have some family members who have attended RMIT University and have become school alumni. They had positive things to say about the university and the city campus.

-   <u>City campus</u>

RMIT’s campus is spread across Melbourne city, which allows for easy accessibility to almost anything.

-   <u>The online open day material given was excellent</u>

Finally, it was the universities virtual open-day and materials sent to prospect students which I found was the best of all universities, therefore leading me to have RMIT as my preference.

**Figure 2:** Solution Architect job snapshot

## Description

A solution architect’s job is to create a design for applications or systems within an organisation. According to my personality traits, I tend to be independent and creative. Therefore, I believe that this type of role would better suit my personality. I would be able to create designs based on my vision, as opposed to working as a developer who merely creates based on another’s ideas.

## Skills: 

Currently, whilst I have to an extent, the skills in terms of my ability to communicate, discipline, teamwork, perseverance, and problem solving, I still lack significantly in these areas. Furthermore, I am completely new to learning the tools required within this field. The closest I have come to learning how to work with anything technology related was in my year 10 programming class, in which we were briefly taught how to use the program “Scratch”. Therefore, I recognise that I have no usuable skills in technology at this time, but I’m here to learn!

## Skills Required: 

The skills required for this position include:

-   Many years of experience working within the IT industry.

-   Exceptional communication skills.

-   Enhanced analytical skills.

-   Documentation and technical writing skills.

-   Ability to interpret business requirements into technology solutions.

-   Relevant IT qualifications

## Learning Plan

Upon completing my Bachelor of Information Technology, I will begin by starting off in a developer role, and over time, complete numerous certifications such as the AWS Solutions Architect certification (Amazon Web Services 2020, para. 6) but also, the equivalent Microsoft credentials like “Azure Solutions Architect Expert” certificate (krsanty 2021, para. 1). Furthermore, as I progress, I will take part in role-based industry training and lastly obtain a mentor for insight in regard to the occupation of being a solutions architect. Lastly, I will engage in self learning using applications such as Pluralsight to enhance my skills and “adopt new tools” (Pluralsight 2020, para. 1).

# Personal Profile

## Test 1: Myers Briggs Type Indicator:

I completed the Myers Briggs type indicator test and found it interesting. I had never completed this kind of test before. I am an ISFP-A “Adventurer”. My results are found in Figure 3 below.

<img src="media\image3.png" style="width:3.09236in;height:3.40276in" />

**Figure 3:** Myers Briggs Type Indicator 2021

My Myers Briggs results indicated the following strengths and weaknesses for my personality type:

| **STRENGTHS** | **WEAKNESSES**          |
|---------------|-------------------------|
| Charming      | Independence            |
| Sensitive     | Unpredictability        |
| Imagination   | Easily stressed         |
| Passion       | Competitive             |
| Curiosity     | Fluctuating self-esteem |
| Creative      |                         |

## Test 2: Learning Preferences (“What’s Your Learning Style? 20 Questions” 2020)

I completed this test to identify what kind of learning style suits me, these are my results:

-   Auditory 25%, Visual 30%, Tactile: 45% (education planner 2020)

This learning test has come back with the results of me being a “tactile” learner, meaning that I am able to understand more so and remember by performing the task at hand than merely listening to and trying to remember another person’s descriptions. Furthermore, it has indicated that I am required to take numerous breaks throughout my studies in order to be better focused. IT is a tactile kind of environment, so I am hoping it suits me.

## Test 3: The Big 5

I completed ‘the Big 5’ personality test, which “measures the big five personality traits using the IPIP Big-Five Factor Markers” ((“Big Five Personality Test” 2019). My results are in Figure 4 below:

<img src="media\image4.png" style="width:6.26806in;height:1.39514in" />

**Figure 4:** Big Five Personality Test 2019

On this Big Five Personality test, the results have indicated that in Factor 1 I am in between being introverted and extraverted. In Factor 2 I am relatively higher in terms of emotional stability. On the other hand, it seems I am very friendly and optimistic with a very high score of 93. Factor 4, Conscientiousness, implies that I am a bit of a mix between being careful and hardworking but could also mean that I am impulsive and unsystematic. Finally, Factor 5, Intellect/Imagination highlights that I am open to new experiences for the most part; however, at times also tend to be more conservative.

## Overall Consensus:

These results indicate that I am a more introverted person, which would mean that within a work group environment I would be less talkative when compared with an extravert. This result did not surprise me. There are a few potential weaknesses that have been highlighted such as being unsystematic, unpredictable, and easily stressed.  I will need to consider these and try to address them.  Everyone will have a different personality, background, and experiences. It is for such reasons that when forming a group, we need to make sure that there is a mix of different personalities, in order to have broader ideas in regards to the project.

# PROJECT IDEA – SAFE RAP (Save Animals From Euthanization – Rescue Animals Project)

## Overview 

Thousands of animals are euthanized each year in the USA and Australia alone. This application seeks to reduce those numbers. “SAFE RAP” will be both an Android and IOS application targeted towards those who are looking to adopt a pet and/or help contribute to shelter animals. This application will also be catered for Animal shelters and other organisations that deal with abandoned pets, allowing them to put the animal up for adoption via the application. This application will primarily run similar to a ‘dating app’, in which the animals (primarily dogs and cats) will be put on the page with a small bio, to which the users are able to swipe left or right depending on which they are interested in. Information is exchanged as well as any payment for animals rescued. Users will also be able to donate to the animal shelters.

## Motivation 

The number of dogs and cats put in shelters and euthanized each year is alarmingly high. “Each year, approximately 1.5 million shelter animals are euthanized (670,000 dogs and 860,000 cats)” in the U.S. alone (Pet Statistics 2015, para. 2) with a total of “28,072” dogs, and “45,364” cats being brought into the RSPCA in the 2019-2020 financial year (RSPCA 2021, para. 3) . (Figure 5)

**Figure 5**: Total animals received 2019-2020 (RSPCA 2021)


Whilst this application may not solve the problem at hand, it give the animals a higher chance of being rescued than the currently have, it gives those looking to purchase a pet an alternate option, as well as highlight animal shelters and the issue to the public. For instance, if we could just save ten percent of dogs given up in the USA alone, we have the potential to save around 67,000 animals, which is still incredible. (Figure 6, a dog waiting to be rescued)

## Description 

This application will be primarily targeted to those who are looking to adopt a pet and/or help contribute to shelter animals, individuals who are wanting to put their pet up for adoption, as well as animal shelters and other organisations that deal with abandoned pets.

Upon opening the application, the user (adopter) will be required to sign up and create their own personal profile, including their full name, location, living conditions (do they have a back yard or not?) and finally their preferred animal being either a dog or a cat as well as its sex, breed, colour, size, etc..

On the other hand, if the user is looking to put their animal up for adoption, they must also include pictures of their animal to show potential adopters, proof of ownership over the animal (e.g., a microchip and documentation details). This is to prevent fraud from taking place throughout the processes (only verified users will be able to put animals up for adoption, ownership details verified at exchange with the animal).

Once finishing the sign up and profile, users will be sent to a page of animals listed within their location and matching the preferences initially described. Users are then given the option to swipe left (dismiss) or right (shortlist) depending on whether the bio and pictures of the matched animal profiles spark their interests.

Furthermore, users will be able to make a contribution through the donation button, even if they don’t adopt an animal, in which they will be allowed to send any sum of money to a registered shelter (not individuals) in order to support those organisations. After deciding to swipe right for example, the listed animal will go on to their profiles shortlist. From there, they can complete the transaction (like a check-out on Ebay). The animal profile would already have contact information for the shelter so inquiries about the animal and/or how to proceed with the transaction (will they go to pick up the animal, or will it be dropped off to their property?) could be done offline.

However, as this is a high-level project, we will need to further socialise through the use of surveys amongst the general public, as well as gaining more insight as to how animal shelters operate, in order to gain a better and more in depth understanding of what other features would be expected to implement into the application. This would be done with the aim of raising the overall user experience and the quality of the final product.

Here is a high level list of features of the SAFE RAP application:

### Features: 

-   Security

    -   Verification of animal ownership (e.g., Microchip number, papers/ID of the animal)

    -   User profile security (i.e., confidentiality of user personal details and payment information)

    -   Authentication of users via password. All users require a username and password.

        -   Social media login (via Facebook, Instagram, Google, etc.) is a nice feature to have.

-   Profiles

    -   There would be a profile for each target audience/users of the application:

        -   Individuals looking to adopt a pet and/or help contribute to shelter animals.

        -   Those who are wanting to put their pet up for adoption (Animal owner).

        -   Animal shelters and other organisations that deal with abandoned pets.

    -   Animal owner profile, to capture characteristics of the animal, such as:

        -   Name

        -   Breed

        -   Sex

        -   Age

        -   Colour

        -   Desexed Y/N

        -   Vaccinated Y/N

        -   Microchipped Y/N, if yes, microchip number

        -   Images; a number of images of the animal

        -   Temperament, a description of the animals’ temperament, if known

        -   Background, a description of the animals’ backgrounds i.e., why/how it has come to be put up for adoption

        -   Planned euthanization date, when the animal will be put down

        -   Owner details

            -   Name

            -   Address

            -   Email

            -   Phone Number

    -   Shelter profile

        -   Name

        -   Business number

        -   Address and phone number

        -   Email address

    -   Owner/Adopter profile

        -   Specific details including name and contact information for pet adopters

            -   Name

            -   Address

            -   Email

            -   Phone Number

        -   Property details – (e.g. large back yard, apartment, etc.)

        -   Own other pets? (Yes, No. plus options to provide detail)

        -   Size of family and number of children

        -   Characteristics of animal they would like to adopt (similar details as in animal profile)

-   Ability to take payments

-   Donation Button (if you don’t want to or cannot adopt, the application allows to make a contribution)

-   Animals are matched against the requirements entered by those looking to adopt

-   Geographic location (set in profile, can only see animals within your country and matched to those in areas you’ve specified)

-   Notifications - users are notified when the is a match or interest in the animal

-   Users can swipe left or right to scroll through the animals they have been matched with. Swiping right will shortlist, left will dismiss that choice.

-   An options bar will allow users to donate, choose an animal (and go through payment etc.) or go back, skip.

## Skills Required:

-   **Marketing ability:** In order for the users to know of the application, marketing of the application in various channels will be needed.

-   **Coding:** Mobile app development in our chosen languages is required.

-   **Cloud Infrastructure:** Understanding of using various cloud technologies, licencing and connectivity is required.

-   **Security:** Understanding of security rules regarding protecting user privacy and authentication methods is needed.

-   **Communication:** Team members will need to be able to communicate with each other to deliver the final application.

-   **Design:** Skills in user experience and design and associated tools such as Figma are needed to develop a prototype.

-   **Testing:** Skills in testing methods and processes are required to ensure a better-quality code.

-   **Database:** Skills in NoSQL databases (Firebase) and relational databases to create backend databases.

-   **API and Integration:** Skills to integrate front-end to back-end services such as integrating the payment gateway.

## Outcome:

If this project is successful, the problem of the thousands of animals who are placed in animal shelters and are euthanized each year will hopefully be reduced worldwide. Whilst this application will most likely not completely solve this issue, it aims to reduce the numbers as much as possible. As there would be a centralised application for all shelters and people to use, it would be easier for all to view animals, adopt, or just donate. Currently people need to look up these things from many different sources, or just go to the ones they know about. Making something easier like this application would do, would help get more users. So, having more users, making it easier, should reduce the numbers and help rescue animals. As previously mentioned, just a small percentage saved translates to thousands of animals.
